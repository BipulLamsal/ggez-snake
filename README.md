ggez-snake &middot; üêç
=====
Classic snake game just to test if rust is in game yet? [Are we game yet?](https://arewegameyet.rs/)
used ggez just to fool around, I checked gegez snake [example](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/examples/04_snake.rs) but couldn't understand and created my own.
Maybe someday, I will implement it on WASM.
